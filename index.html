        <p class="large">Welcome.</p>
        <p class="med">If you're new to Game of Thrones or simply lost, you're at the right place.
        The biggest gripe some people have when starting this show is that it is difficult to follow.
        <br><br>It's expected - the family tree is massive and there is a long history. You could open
        wikipedia and read pages of text, but I have created this site to prepare you for the show in
        a visually appealing way.
        <br><br>Yes, this is spoiler-free, in case you were worried. Nothing from the show is given away,
        just what you should know before jumping into season one. If you're ready, keep scrolling.</p>

        <p class="large">If you didn't know already...</p>
        <p class="med">Game of Thrones is an adaptation of the series of fantasy novels known as A Song
          of Ice and Fire, written by George R. R. Martin. Easy - let's move on.

          <p class="large">Where at?</p>
          <p class="med">Majority of the show takes place in a continent known as Westeros. On this magical land is a
          realm known as the Seven Kingdoms, which despite its name, is actually nine regions. Some stuff went
          down resulting in the nine there are now, but we don't need to delve into that.

        <p class="large">The Seven Kingdoms</p>
        <p class="med">For each region, there are many houses (interpret them as families),
          but only one of those houses hold power over their respective
          region - they are called the Great Houses. So, with nine regions come nine Great Houses.
          The nine regions in The Seven Kindgoms are below:
          <br><br>The North
          <br>The Iron Islands
          <br>The Riverlands
          <br>The Vale of Arryn
          <br>The Westerlands
          <br>The Crownlands
          <br>The Reach
          <br>The Stormlands
          <br>Dorne
          <br><br> We'll get to the Great Houses for those regions in a bit.

          <p class="large">The Iron Throne</p>
          <p class="med">The ruler of the Seven Kingdoms sits on the Iron Throne and holds power over everyone.
            The Iron Throne is located in King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.
            The house of whomever is the King (called the Royal House)
            therefore has large influence over everything imaginable. You can now understand why the battle
            for the Iron Throne is so important - all houses want that power and influence.

        <p class="large">The Houses</p>
        <p class="med">While there are hundreds of houses in the Seven Kingdoms, there are a select few that are
          the focus of the show, and we will be looking at those only. You can hover over each shield/sigil
          to get a brief overview of the houses.
