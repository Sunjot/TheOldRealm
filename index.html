          If you're new to Game of Thrones or a couple episodes in and lost, you're not alone.
          Given the large family trees and long history, many find this show difficult to follow
          when you're starting out.<br><br>
          I have built this site to cover all the important pieces of information that
          you'll need to know before diving into season 1. Don't worry, it's spoiler-free.

        <p class="smaller">
          Note: If you're on a large device (desktop, laptop), there are animations involved as you scroll down,
          but if your browser can't handle them, feel free to use <a style="color:white" href="#">this version</a>
          of the site without all the fancy stuff. Mobile device users don't need to worry about animations (they
          are disabled automatically), but if issues arise, use the link above as well.

            On this magical land is a realm known as the Seven Kingdoms, which covers most of the continent.
            The remaining area is the northernmost part, referred to as Beyond The Wall (white region).

              The Seven Kingdoms, despite its name, is actually made up of nine regions: The North,
              The Iron Islands, The Riverlands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Crownlands, The Reach,
              The Stormlands, and Dorne. Each of these regions contain many houses (families), but
              only one of the houses in each region hold authority over their respective area -
              they are known as the Great Houses. So, with nine regions come nine Great Houses.
              We'll go over those in a bit.

              An extremely large wall separates The Seven Kingdoms from the area to the north
              and is defended by a military order known as the Night's Watch. The people living
              north of the wall are called the Free Folk, and are referred to as
              wildlings. These guys aren't fans
              of the people in the south or their feudal system and choose to follow only
              those they want to. Those in the Seven Kingdoms share a similar opinion about
              their "free" culture beyond the wall.

        <p class="large">Robert's Rebellion </p>
        <p id="padding" class="small">Remember how I mentioned at the beginning this show has a large family tree,
          thus making it difficult to understand at first? Well, the top of the family tree (or at least from
          where it matters to us) requires an understanding of the events that took place before the series.
          Robert's Rebellion is a war that happened some time before the show. Full details are available
          <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion"> here</a>, but I will
          attempt to summarize the article.<br><br>

          House Taragaryen was a dynasty that ruled the Seven Kingdoms for 300 years.
          Aerys Targaryen was the King right before Robert's Rebellion. He had 2 kids with Rhaella
          Targaryen: Rhaegar and Viserys. He was on the crazy side, having people killed
          left and right, and houses rebelled against him. His son Rhaegar was married to Elia
          Martell (Targaryen-Martell alliance), but said fuck her, and went and abducted Lyanna Stark,
          who was engaged to Robert Baratheon (Stark-Baratheon alliance).
          <br><br>

          As expected, the Starks and Baratheons didn't appreciate that very much, and wanted answers.
          Lyanna's brother (Brandon Stark) was arrested for treason, and Aerys requested Lyanna's father
          (Rickard Stark) show up to court. When he got there, both Brandon and Rickard were murdered.
          <br><br>

          House Arryn, Baratheon, and Stark, who all rebelled against Aerys, formed an alliance with House
          Tully through marriage. Lyanna's other brother, Eddard Stark, married Caetlyn Tully, and
          Jon Arryn, the head of House Arryn, married Lysa Tully. Robert Baratheon ended up killing
          Rhaegar during a large fight known as the Battle of the Trident.
          <br><br>

          Elia Martell, meanwhile, was being kept by Aerys to make sure the Martells didn't ditch House Targaryen
          during the war. During the Sack of King's Landing, where House Lannister betrayed House Targaryen
          and sacked the city, Jamie Lannister killed Aerys, thus becoming known as the King Slayer. Elia was
          raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane,also known as The Mountain. Lyanna also died during the war,
          but the reasons are unknown.
          <br><br>

          Robert claimed the Iron Throne and married Cersei Lannister as a thanks to House Lannister for taking down the
          Targaryens, and Jon Arryn was named the Hand of the King. Rhaella Targaryen, wife of Aerys, fled
          to Dragonstone with her son Viserys while pregnant, where she gave birth to her and (now late)
          Aerys's third child, Daenerys Targaryen. Rhaella died shortly after. That brings us to season 1, and
          I can now move on to the family tree.
