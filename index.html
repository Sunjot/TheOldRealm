          Welcome.
        </p>
        <p class="med">
          If you're new to Game of Thrones or a couple episodes in and lost, read on.
          This show is considered one of the more difficult shows to follow when you're starting out
          due to the large family trees and the long history.<br><br>
          So, I have created this site to prepare those who wish to begin the series or are
          having trouble following along. I'll be covering all the important pieces of information that
          you'll need to know before diving into season 1. Don't worry, it's spoiler-free.

        <p class="med">
          Game of Thrones is an adaptation of the series of fantasy novels known as A Song
          of Ice and Fire, written by George R. R. Martin. Easy - let's move on.

          <p class="med">
            The world of Game of Thrones consists of 4 continents. However, majority
            of the show takes place on the one known as Westeros (left region on the map).
            On this magical land is a realm known as the Seven Kingdoms, which covers most of Westeros.
            The remaining area is the northernmost part of the continent, referred to as Beyond The Wall (white
            area you see on the map, if you couldn't tell already).

            As mentioned above, Westeros is made up of 2 regions: the Seven Kingdoms
            and Beyond The Wall. We'll have a brief look at each.

              Seven Kingdoms
            </p>
            <p class="small">
              The Seven Kingdoms, despite its name, is actually made up of nine regions: The North,
              The Iron Islands, The Riverlands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Crownlands, The Reach,
              The Stormlands, and Dorne. Each of these regions contain many houses (families), but
              only one of the houses in each region hold authority over their respective area -
              they are known as the Great Houses. So, with nine regions come nine Great Houses.
              We'll go over those in a bit.

            <p class="small">
              An extremely large wall separates The Seven Kingdoms from the area to the north
              and is defended by a military order known as the Night's Watch. The people living
              north of the wall are called the Free Folk, and are referred to as
              wildlings. These guys aren't fans
              of the people in the south or their feudal system and choose to follow only
              those they want to. Those in the Seven Kingdoms share a similar opinion about
              their "free" culture beyond the wall.

              The ruler of the Seven Kingdoms sits on the Iron Throne and holds
              political authority and final say in all decisions. The Iron Throne
              is located in King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.
              The house of whomever is the King is called the Royal House. The
              battle for the Iron Throne is central to the show as everyone wants
              that power and influence over the Seven Kingdoms.

              The Small Council is a group appointed by and advisor to the King and the King's Hand.
              When decisions need to be made regarding the economy or law, the King and Hand
              usually get together with the Small Council to consider their options. However,
              final say is still up to the King - they are only there to provide pros/cons, etc.

              Each of the Great Houses have multiple vassals, which are just smaller houses that
              have pledged an allegiance to that Great House. These vassals in turn could have
              their own vassals, and so on. The rulers of the lower-level vassals (known as landed
              knights) report to the head of the vassal above them, and the heads of the top
              layer of vassals report to the head of the Great House they hold fealty to. You get the idea.
